        When French toast is served as a sweet dish, sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon are also commonly added before
        pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a
        savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such
        as ketchup or mayonnaise.<br>

        Slices of bread are soaked or dipped in a mixture of beaten eggs, often whisked with milk or cream. Sliced or
        artisan loaves cut to 3⁄4–1 in (1.9–2.5 cm) thick are frequently used as the bread of choice.[24] Sugar,
        cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla may be variously added to the mixture. The bread is then fried in butter or olive
        oil until browned and cooked through. Day-old bread is often used, both for its thrift and because it will soak
        up more egg mixture without falling apart...<br>
