      <p class="description">
        Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream
        and cherries. It is decorated with additional whipped cream, maraschino cherries, and chocolate shavings.
        Traditionally Kirschwasser, a clear alcoholic spirit made from sour cherries, is added to the cake.[2] Other
        spirits are sometimes used, such as rum, which is common in Austrian recipes. German law mandates that any
        dessert labelled Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte must have Kirschwasser.[3].<br>

        The origin of the cake's name is unclear. The confectioner Josef Keller [de] (1887–1981) claimed to have
        invented Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte in its present form in 1915 at the prominent Café Agner in Bad Godesberg, now
        a suburb of Bonn and actually some 300 km (190 mi) north of the Black Forest. The claim, however, has never been
        substantiated.[4] Centuries ago, cherries, cream, and Kirschwasser were combined in the form of a dessert in
        which cooked cherries were served with cream and Kirschwasser. This tradition originated in the Black Forest
        region of southwestern Germany, known for its many cherry groves..<br>
